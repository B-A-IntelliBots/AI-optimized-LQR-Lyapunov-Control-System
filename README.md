# AI-Optimized LQR-Lyapunov Control System

This project presents the design, modeling, simulation, and control of a camera-equipped differential-drive robotic platform for **environment mapping and 3D reconstruction**.  
The robot autonomously navigates a discretized path, stopping at specific points to capture images for mapping.

# üìñ Overview & Methodology

### 1. Vehicle Modeling
The kinematic and dynamic models of the robot were derived under **ideal motion conditions** (no slip, slide, or bounce).

### 2. Control Objectives
The control system was designed to meet the following objectives:
1. **Trajectory adherence**  
   The path between consecutive reference points should converge to the straight line connecting them.
2. **Arrival heading angle**  
   Upon reaching a target point, the robot‚Äôs heading should align with the inclination angle of the line connecting start and target points, ensuring smooth transitions.
3. **Elapsed time**  
   The traversal time between two target points should be minimal.

<div align="center">

*These objectives are combined into a single performance error metric, which facilitates optimal control gain selection.*

</div>

### 3. Control System Design
The controller was structured into two loops:

- **High-level control loop**  
  Generates linear and angular reference velocity profiles that guide the robot to the target.  
  - Uses Lyapunov stability criterion for stable velocity profiles (based on position/orientation errors).  
  - Incorporates an **MLP neural network** to adaptively choose optimal control gains.  

- **Low-level control loop**  
  Ensures the dynamic system tracks the reference velocities quickly.  
  - Uses **LQR method** with a full-order observer.  

### 4. Neural Network Training
The MLP neural network selects optimal high-level control gains that balance the three objectives.  

- Training dataset generation: [training_data_generation](https://github.com/B-A-IntelliBots/AI-optimized-LQR-Lyapunov-Control-System/tree/main/training_data_generation)  
- Training code: [MLP_training](https://github.com/B-A-IntelliBots/AI-optimized-LQR-Lyapunov-Control-System/tree/main/MLP_training)

### 5. MATLAB Simulation
The trained neural network was integrated into MATLAB simulations to evaluate performance on various paths.  

The table below shows:
- **Row 1**: Neural network-based controller (PNN) outperforming Lyapunov and PID controllers.  
- **Row 2**: PNN performance on discretized Line, Circle, and Infinity-shaped trajectories.

### 6. ROS and Gazebo Simulation
The control algorithm was ported to ROS for execution on a **Raspberry Pi**, with an **Arduino** acting as an interface for motors and sensors (via serial communication).

#### Gazebo Simulation
Before real-world deployment, the robot was tested in Gazebo under realistic conditions:
