# AI-optimized-LQR-Lyapunov-Control-System

This project aims to design, model, simulate and control a camera-equipped robotic platform designated for environment mapping purposes. The robot should autonomously navigate the environment through a prebuilt discretized path involving a halt at each specified point on the path to capture images for the environment.
Afterdefining the project requirements and the primary purpose of the mobile platform, adifferential-drive wheeled mobile robot was selected due to its simplicity in design and control, as well as its effectiveness in achieving the intended objectives. 
The project's workflow can be divided as follows:
## Vehicle Modeling
First the kinematic and dynamic models of the robot has been extracted. In this section we assumed  pure motion conditions, i.e., the robot does not encounter and slip, slide, or bounce.
## Control objective formulation
This robotic platform is designated for environmental mapping purposes "3D reconstruction". For that sake, the control system should be designed to acheive the objectives related to this task. These objectives are broken down as follow
### 1. Trajectory adherence objective
The robot path between two consequtive reference points should converge to the straight line connecting these two points.
### 2. Arrival heading angle objective
The arrival heading angle of the robot ubon reaching the target point should be as close to the inclination angle of the straight line connecting the starting and target point. This guarantees smooth motion over consequtive target points.
### 3. Elapsid time
The time taken to traverse the path between two target points should be minimal.
## Control system design
The control system, that drives the state of the robot to the desired state, has been divided into two loops:
### 1. High level control loop
This loop is concerned about generating the linear and angular reference velocity profiles that guarantees carrying the robot fron the starting position to the target position. The high level control loop incorporates Lyapunov stability criterion to set stable velocity profiles using postion and orienation errors with control gains. In addtion, this loop utilizes an MLP neural network that adaptively choose the best high level control gains that yeilds the path satisfying the control objectives outlined previusly.
### 2. Low level control loop
This loop is concerned about governing the dynamic system to follow the reference velocity profiles as fast as possible. It incorporate LQR method with full order observer.
## Neural Network Training Process
As stated previously, the neural network is responisble for selecting the optimal high level control gains that achieve a tade off between the three control objectives yeilding the best path to follow. this network takes the target (x,y) postion as input and outputs (Kp,Kth) control gains that determine how the path should look like toward the target point starting from the current point. 
first of all, the training data is gathered usingn MATLAB. This done by spaning the circle arround the robot with diameter of 1 meter, then for each target point
