'''
Trajectory Controller Node

This node defines a sequence of target waypoints for the robot to follow.  
For each waypoint, it:
  1. Calls the control service ("next_step") to iteratively move the robot until the target is reached within tolerance.
  2. Stops the robot and calls the capturing service ("capture_images") to record images for mapping.  

Finally, it plots the executed path for visualization.
